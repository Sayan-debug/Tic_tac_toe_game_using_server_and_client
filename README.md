# Tic_tac_toe_game_using_server_and_client
I have written a program where two players connect to a server in order to
play the game of tic-tac-toe interactively. A k x k board is stored in a shared
memory segment in the server. Moves alternate between two remote clients
until a player wins or the game ends in a draw. The winning position is
indicated by a row or a column or a major diagonal being filled up with the
same symbol (X or O). All connections are made by TCP. The server processes
synchronize by using semaphores.
The server waits for two clients to request for a new game. Upon the request of
each player (client), a new process in spawned to handle the client. When the
game is over, the server resumes waiting for two more players to connect for
starting a new game.
Suppose that C1 and C2 are the two client processes that are allowed access to
play the game. The corresponding server processes are called S1 and S2 . For
simplicity, you may assume that the client process which connects earlier (say,
C1 ) plays X and makes the first move.
The board is initialized by the server in the shared memory segment and is
accessible to both the spawned processes S1 and S2 . These processes
synchronize by using two semaphores σ1 and σ2 both initialized to zero.
Initially, S1 waits on σ1 .
When C2 connects, the parent process forks S2 and signals on σ1 to start S1.
When it is the turn of C1 to make the move, S1 first sends the current board to
C1 and then waits for a valid move from C1 . The other process S2 waits on the
semaphore σ2 . When C1 supplies a move, S1 updates the board in the shared
memory, signals the semaphore σ2 and then waits on the semaphore σ1 again.
The process S2 now wakes up (since σ2 is signaled) and serves C2 in an
analogous fashion.
Before sending any board position to the client, a server process always checks
whether the game is over. If so, it terminates after sending the board position.
A client process, upon reception of a board position, checks whether the game
is over. If so, it prints an appropriate message and exits.
The parent server process waits for both the child processes S1 and S2 to
terminate and then waits for a new game.
Given two C source files: tttserver.c and tttclient.c.
